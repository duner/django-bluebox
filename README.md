# django-bluebox
Work in Progress App to help you publish your content to Apple News, FB Instant Articles, AMP-HTML and whatever the next proprietary standard your content will need to be available in.

####What's with the name?
In the Animorphs books, which I adored as a kid, touching the [Blue Box](http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/Escafil_device) gave the protagonists the power to "morph" into other animals — hopefully this app will let you "morph" your content from one format to another. Also, it's kindof a riff on the concept of a [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box) — "a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings. Hopefully using `django-bluebox` will be that easy.
